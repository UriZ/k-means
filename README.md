# k-means
This repository contains an implementation of the k-means algorithm:
- stand alone implementation 
- an Azure Function running the algorithm 

# Algorithm 
Given a set of observations (x1, x2, …, xn), where each observation is a d-dimensional real vector, k-means clustering aims to partition the n observations into k (≤ n) sets S = {S1, S2, …, Sk} so as to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares.

# Usage 
- The function can be trigered by a console application, available here: https://github.com/UriZ/kmconsole and running here: http://173.193.107.30:31798/
- To test the function directly, you can use the attached Postman collection to get started
